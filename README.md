# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

The aim of the project was to apply Python programming skills by creating a game. 

Through this project, I was able to better understand object-oriented programming concepts and practice version control with Git and Github.

## Dependencies
To play this game, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python: The game is written in Python, so you need to have Python installed. You can download it from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/).
